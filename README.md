  - <strong>SwiftUI (Playgrounds)</strong>
    - For the development of MixinUP, I exclusively utilized SwiftUI for all logic and interface management. Additionally, within the project, I make use of multiple animations, both with environment-specific modifiers (such as withAnimation) and custom animations primarily created using ternary values. Furthermore, the core functionality of this application is focused on the dragging of images displayed on the screen. To achieve this, I utilize dragGesture while also validating collisions either with CGPoints or CGRects, thus manipulating the behavior of my elements according to my ideas.
